# Continuous Integration and Deployment with AWS

In the upcoming lecture we will be adding a script to our .travis.yml file. Due to a change in how the Jest library works
with Create React App, we need to make a small modification

instead should be:

script:
  - docker run -e CI=true USERNAME/docker-react npm run test
Additionally, you may want to set the following property to the top of your .travis.yml file:

language: generic 


## A Touch More Travis Setup
> docker run <image_id> npm run test -- coverage


## Travis Keys Update
In the upcoming lecture we will be adding our AWS variables to the deploy script of the .travis.yml file. There is a slight change that will be required, otherwise you will get an error when Travis attempts to run your code.

The code will now look like this:

access_key_id: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key: $AWS_SECRET_KEY
